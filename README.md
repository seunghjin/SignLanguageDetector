##Primitive Sign Language Detector
Hello, this is my attempt at using deep learning to recognize certain words in sign language shown to the camera feed. For now, it only recognizes: I, love, and you. I plan to keep adding more words to the dictionary. Enough to be able to hold a conversation of any topic whatsoever. One step at a time though.
